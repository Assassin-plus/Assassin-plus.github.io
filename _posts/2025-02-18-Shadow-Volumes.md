A method based on *shadow volumes* can cast shadows onto arbitrary objects by clever use of the stencil buffer. It can be used on any GPU, as the only requirement is a stencil buffer. It is not image based (unlike the shadow map algorithm described next) and so avoids sampling problems, thus producing correct sharp shadows everywhere. This can sometimes be a disadvantage. For example, a character¡Çs clothing may have folds that give thin, hard shadows that alias badly. Shadow volumes are rarely used today, due to their unpredictable cost.

### Dark/Light mode & Shadow

The image below will toggle dark/light mode based on theme preference, notice it has shadows.

![light mode only](/posts/20190808/devtools-light.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow .rounded-10 w='1212' h='668' }
![dark mode only](/posts/20190808/devtools-dark.png){: .dark .w-75 .shadow .rounded-10 w='1212' h='668' }
